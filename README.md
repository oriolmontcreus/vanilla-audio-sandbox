# 🎵 Sound Sandbox 🎵

Sound Sandbox is an interactive web application that allows users to create and manipulate sounds in a fun and intuitive way. 

## 🌟 Features

- **🥁 Drum Pad**: The application includes a drum pad that can be used to play different sounds. Each pad corresponds to a different sound and can be triggered by clicking on it or pressing the corresponding key on the keyboard.

- **📤 Sound Upload**: Users can upload their own audio files to be used in the drum pad. The application supports all audio file types.

- **🎛️ Channel Rack**: The channel rack allows users to sequence sounds in a grid-like interface. Each row corresponds to a different sound and each column corresponds to a different point in time.

- **🎮 Control Pad**: The control pad allows users to control the playback of the sounds sequenced in the channel rack.
